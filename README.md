# so_long
so_long project at 42 School

This project is a small 2D game that is written entirely in C, from the common core of 42 School.

It uses the [MiniLibX](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux)

Only open, close, read, write, malloc, free, perror, strerror, exit and MiniLibX functions were authorized.
Because of that, the game runs on X11 or XWayland, and can't be Wayland-native.

Organization of files, readability of code and/or the names of functions can seem awful, because of the [42 Norm](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/42School/norminette/master/pdf/en.norm.pdf) that limits the length of a line to 80, number of functions in a file to 5, and number of lines in a function to 25.

You can easily replace all textures with other 64x64 textures, that you can find in https://itch.io
