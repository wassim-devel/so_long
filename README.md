so_long project at 42 School

This project is a small 2D game from the common core of 42 School.

Organization of files, readability of code and/or the names of functions can seem awful, because of the [42 Norm](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/42School/norminette/master/pdf/en.norm.pdf) that limits the length of a line to 80, number of functions in a file to 5, and number of lines in a function to 25.

You can easily replace all textures with other 64x64 textures, that you can find in https://itch.io
